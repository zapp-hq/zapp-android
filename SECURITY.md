## Critical Security Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Data Protection
- **Private Keys**: Must be stored in hardware-backed security modules
- **Message Storage**: Minimize temporary storage, implement secure deletion
- **Metadata**: Protect against traffic analysis and timing attacks
- **Backup**: Secure key backup and recovery procedures

### Threat Model
- **Device Compromise**: Private keys protected by hardware security
- **Network Attacks**: All communication encrypted end-to-end
- **Server Compromise**: Zero knowledge - server cannot access plaintext
- **Quantum Threats**: Plan for post-quantum cryptography migration

### Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR**: Data minimization, user consent, right to deletion
- **Regional Laws**: Compliance with local encryption regulations
- **Export Controls**: Cryptography export compliance
- **Industry Standards**: NIST, OWASP, security frameworks

## Testing Commands üß™

### Development Testing
```bash
# Run all cryptographic tests
flutter test test/crypto_test.dart

# Performance benchmarks  
flutter test test/performance_test.dart --enable-asserts

# Integration tests
flutter test integration_test/
```

### Manual Testing
```dart
// In your app's debug mode
final testPassed = await CryptoTestSuite.runAllTests();
print('All tests passed: \$testPassed');
```

### Security Validation
```bash
# Static analysis
flutter analyze

# Dependency vulnerabilities
flutter pub deps --json | dart security_scanner.dart

# Code quality
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .
```

## Emergency Procedures üö®

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate**: Disable affected services
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Prevent further compromise
4. **Recovery**: Restore secure operations
5. **Communication**: Notify affected users
6. **Post-mortem**: Analyze and improve

### Key Compromise
1. **Immediate key rotation** for affected devices
2. **Revoke compromised certificates**
3. **Audit message history** for potential exposure
4. **User notification** with remediation steps
5. **Enhanced monitoring** for suspicious activity
